What is inheritance?
= The process of obtaining the data members and functions
  from one class to another class is known as inheritance.

What are the importance of inheritance?
= code re-usability
  application development time is less
  application take less memory
  application execution time is less

There are 5 types of inheritance
1. Single  = In this sort of inheritance, one subclass inherit from one superclass.
2. Multilevel  =  one superclass for one is the subclass for another.
3. Hierarchical  = Multiple subclass derived form single superclass.
