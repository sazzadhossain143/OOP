/*
what is encapsulation?
= Encapsulation is a process of
1. combining variable and function in a single unit (class)
2. protecting data by declaring them as private

what is data hiding?
= Private data will be hidden from other classes and they can only be accessed through
public function of their current class. That is known as data hiding.
